# CS 205 Final Project Group 7: Jacob Drake, Nick Laware, Ethan Bokelberg, Jake Regele  
For sprint 1, we have the logic for playing chess functioning by running the ChessRandomAIWorking.py, displaying a board printed to the terminal, playing
against the computer by having the computer select random valid moves on its turn.
tkinter_test.py is the beginnings of our more sophisticated GUI, not finished implementation yet.  
# GUI Implemention comments  
Ethan: I have never used pygame before, so I used [this](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/beyond_pcc/pygame_sprite_sheets/#modeling-a-chess-set) online tutorial to figure out the code for 
cutting out and displaying the individual sprites from our spritesheet.
